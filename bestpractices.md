# Best Practices for Discord Bots in Python (discord.py)

This project follows a set of practices that make your bot reliable, maintainable, and secure. Below is a concise guide to the “why” behind architectural and implementation choices.

## Architecture & Structure

- **Cogs (modular features)**: Commands and listeners are split into cogs like `Welcomecog.py`, `Leavecog.py`, and `autorolecog.py`. This keeps features isolated, easier to test, and maintain.
- **Single entrypoint (`frostmodv3.py`)**: Centralizes startup concerns: environment loading, logging config, DB initialization, extension loading, and application command syncing.
- **Configuration via `.env`**: Secrets (token, DB creds) are not hardcoded. They’re loaded securely with `python-dotenv`.

## Slash Commands & Syncing

- **Slash (app) commands**: Modern, auto-documented by Discord. We restrict to guild-only and set default permissions (`manage_guild`, `manage_messages`) to surface commands to the right users.
- **Developer guild fast sync**: In `setup_hook`, we sync globally and then copy globals to a developer guild for instant iteration.

## Database & Persistence

- **Async PostgreSQL (`asyncpg`)**: Fully async DB driver. We create a pool once and re-use it across cogs via `bot.pool`.
- **Idempotent schema ensure**: On startup, the bot ensures tables exist—safe to run repeatedly and avoids manual steps in development.
- **Prepared writes/reads**: All DB ops use bound parameters to avoid injection risks and to help the server cache execution plans.

## Logging & Observability

- **Structured logging**: Configured in `frostmodv3.py` with timestamps and levels. Every DB read/write is logged for traceability.
- **Actionable diagnostics**: Autorole logs include role hierarchy context and reasons when assignment is skipped.

## Permissions & Security

- **Principle of least privilege**: Commands are permission-gated; the bot only needs intents and permissions required for features.
- **Role hierarchy awareness**: Role assignment checks `me.top_role` vs target role to avoid forbidden errors.
- **Secret handling**: `.env` and `.gitignore` ensure secrets aren’t committed.

## Embeds & UX

- **Consistent styling**: Shared cobalt blue brand color (centralized in `branding.py` as `BRAND_COLOR`) and standard footer text ensure consistent, polished embeds.
- **Ephemeral confirmations**: Administrative commands acknowledge privately to reduce channel noise while still giving operators feedback.

## Error Handling

- **Fail soft**: Listeners handle HTTP exceptions and continue without crashing the bot.
- **Clear warnings**: Logs highlight missing configuration (e.g., DB not set), missing permissions, or hierarchy constraints.

## Performance & Concurrency

- **Connection pooling**: Re-use DB connections for efficient IO.
- **Async throughout**: All IO uses `await` to keep the bot responsive even under load.

## Local Development

- **Start script (`Start_frostmod.bat`)**: Colored console, UTF-8, and unbuffered output for real-time logs.
- **Schema.sql**: Full drop-and-recreate script for easy DB resets during testing.

## Future Enhancements

- **Metrics**: Add Prometheus or simple counters for joins/leaves and command usage.
- **Health checks**: Use the `/status` command for latency/uptime and consider background tasks to verify DB availability.
- **Config viewing**: Add read-only commands to display current guild config.

By following these practices, your Discord bot remains robust, secure, and easy to evolve as requirements change.
